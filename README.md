## THIS IS A DRAFT -- NOT FINALIZED YET

[NE Scala](http://nescala.org) does not select speakers:
you do.

Talks are proposed by you and your peers. Later, we will open up
voting for you to select the talks you want to see.

## How to submit a talk

In this repository, submit a pull request adding a file to the
`proposals` directory with the basics on your talk, including
a one-paragraph summary.

For "length", specify either 45 minutes (long), 30 minutes (medium), or 15 minutes (lightning).

### Formatting

* Use Markdown format
* Copy the [sample proposal](https://github.com/nescalas/proposals-2016/blob/master/proposals/sample-proposal.md)
* For more samples, see [last year's proposals](http://www.nescala.org/2015/talks#proposals)
* Multiple proposals go in separate files
* Filename doesn't really matter, but if you want a suggestion: `lastname--name-of-the-talk.md`
* Don't worry too much about exact formatting; we'll figure it out

## Timeline

* **proposals due:** January 15 @ 11:59pm

## Talk lengths

The following number of talks will be selected by voting:

* 3 long (45 minutes each)
* 4 medium (30 minutes each)
* 4 lightning (15 minutes each)

The timings include time for audience questions, if the speaker chooses to
leave time for them.

## FAQ

* Q: **If my talk gets voted in, am I guaranteed a ticket?**  
A: Yes, but you still have to pay the $60. (Even conference organizers pay.)

* Q: **If my talk isn't voted in, can I still give it at the day 2 unconference?**  
A: Of course. Yes, please!

* Q: **Will videos of the talks be published?**  
A: Yes (unless the speaker objects). Day 1 only, though.

[Open an issue](https://github.com/nescalas/proposals-2016/issues) and
an organizer will answer.  (You can also ask questions in your pull request.)
