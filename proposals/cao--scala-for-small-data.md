In recent times a lot of the buzz around Scala has come from big data, but in this talk we'll take a look from the other side of the lens in the application of Scala (and associated libraries like `akka-streams`, `spire`, `cats`, etc.) for, yes, _artisanal_ small data. Namely, we'll go over why Scala is still a strong choice for your midmajor data engineering needs (like in processing valuable but not uniform data, or in modeling sensible data flows), areas where one-off Python scripts won't do but also where big data tools like Spark may be overkill.
