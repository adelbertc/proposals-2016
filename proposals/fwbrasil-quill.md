[Quill](http://getquill.io) is a compile-time language integrated query library with a powerful query compilation mechanism based on the paper ["A Practical Theory of Language-Integrated Query"](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/slindley/papers/practical-theory-of-linq.pdf). This talk will give an overview of the "Scylla and Charybdis" theorem that supports the query compilation, present the [Quoted Domain Specific Language (QDSL)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/qdsl/qdsl.pdf) approach used by the API, and give a quick view of Quill's functionality.
