This talk will describe the design and implementation of Funnel, a distributed monitoring system that we built at Verizon. It consists of a Scala library for instrumenting your code with metrics, light-weight streaming metric collectors, and a workload manager for the collectors. We used a purely functional design throughout, [and the whole codebase is open source under the Apache 2.0 license] (http://oncue.github.io/funnel/).
