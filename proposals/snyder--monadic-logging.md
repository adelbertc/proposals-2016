Logging is more complicated than most people realize, and when they do, it's too late to do anything about it until "next time."  Learn how to use a writer monad as a logging mechanism in your code.  More importantly though, learn why you would want to do this, and what the benefits are.

There is a price to pay in adopting this approach, but it's more "functional", addresses existing challenges, and enables new, exciting capabilities.
