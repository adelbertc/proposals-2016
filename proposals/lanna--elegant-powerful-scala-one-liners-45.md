In general, statically typed languages have the reputation of being verbose.

Scala is the static language that feels dynamic. With its powerful, flexible,
and expressive syntax, concise yet not terse, a single line of Scala code can
leverage an impressive amount of JVM power.

In this fun, engaging, and interactive live code presentation (done entirely
in the Scala REPL!) I show you some of the most powerful and elegant Scala
one-liners that give us dynamic productivity in a static language.

Bring your REPL, we are going to write some code!

P.S.: A condensed 30-minute version of this talk is also being proposed.
