Scala's type system provides generics in two ways: type members and type
parameters, and most advanced Scala developers will use both in their code at
different times. But how do we choose between them? Usually one or the other
will feel "right" for a particular use case, and—if not—we can usually refactor
and take the alternative approach. But could we learn to be better at making
the "right" choice first time? I'll explore the most important considerations
when choosing between them, and look at whether they are completely
interchangeable in all cases, or whether certain scenarios force us down one
path or the other.
