Statically typed languages, in general, have a bad reputation of being
particularly verbose. Scala is the static language that feels dynamic. With its
powerful, flexible, and expressive syntax, concise yet not terse, a single line
of Scala code can leverage an impressive amount of JVM power.

In this fun, engaging, and interactive live code presentation (done entirely in
the Scala REPL!) I show you some of the most powerful and elegant Scala
one-liners that give us dynamic productivity in a static language. It's not
about short code, it's all about clear code.

Bring your REPL, we are going to write some code!
