Monad Transformers arose as a design pattern to address the difficulties of working with stacks of Monads. While effective, every abstraction has a price. In this presentation we will present an alternative which makes a different set of trade-offs; one built upon category theory but utilitizing many of the language features present in Scala. Part of the discussion will compare how gracefully each works within the type system, highlighting implementation choices and consequences of those choices. We'll showcase a selection of micro benchmarks, both galmorous and calamitous, to understand runtime ramifications. Finally, we'll talk about arguments against, why they are false fears and more importantly why you should be using one or both.
