With Scala.js reaching production-grade, it is now possible to write rich client-server single-page web applications completely
in Scala -- the Server, the Client and even the APIs -- resulting in a system that is strongly-typed from end to end with almost
no duplication or boilerplate. This talk will outline the architecture and some of the key code from Querki, showing how to
use Autowire and Akka to communicate seamlessly between a Scala.js Client and distributed back-end Actors.
