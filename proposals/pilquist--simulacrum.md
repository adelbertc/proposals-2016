Simulacrum simplifies development of type class libraries. It removes boilerplate and provides a consistent user experience for users of type classes. Simulacrum is used in a number of open source projects, including Cats. In this talk, weâ€™ll tour the features of Simulacrum and look at the forthcoming Typeclassic project, which merges Simulacrum with complementary projects like machinist and export-hook.
