Most teams start with Scala as a better Java and slowly adopt functional concepts in their code as they go. Scalaz and Cats are two powerful libraries that fully embrace the functional paradigm and adopting them could be really useful for any scala team, but it can be daunting for those not already inmersed in functional programming. Luckly, with a few core concepts one can be better prepared to understand and get a lot of mileage from functional libraries. 
This talk aims to provide a quick tour of some of those concepts and share different experiences from teams moving in that direction.
