Logic programming is perhaps underappreciated compared to its
declarative sibling, Functional Programming. In this lightning talk,
we will examine a logic programming DSL built on top of microKanren in
Scala. We will demonstrate it's expressive power by using it to help
us find the solution(s) to a particularly mind-bending variant of a
classic puzzle. The goal is to show that we can solve problems
relationally yet write what feels like idiomatic, functional Scala.
