Over the past year, I've been developing my school management website using Scala, Play, and Slick in a more traditions synchronous approach. After reading all the hype and promises of Reactive to make applications more responsive, resilient, elastic, and message driven, I've decided to port my Play application of 8.5k lines of Scala code from Play 2.2/Slick 2.1 to Play 2.4/Slick 3.1. In this presentation, I will first describe the anatomy of a reactive Play/Slick application. I will then go into my async struggles, lessons learned, and patterns discovered of Going Reactive.
