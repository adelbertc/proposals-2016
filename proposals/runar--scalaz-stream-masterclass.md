Scalaz-Stream (soon to be called "FS2" or "Functional Streams for Scala") is a library that lets us write compositional, modular, safe, and efficient asynchronous I/O using an expressive purely functional API. In this hands-on talk we'll see how to get started with the library, cook up a few streams, and look at ways of combining them into larger systems.
